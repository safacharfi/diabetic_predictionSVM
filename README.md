# Diabetic Prediction

This project uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on various health metrics. The model is trained using a dataset that includes features like glucose level, blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), and other relevant medical information.

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to build a predictive model that can aid in the early detection of diabetes. Early diagnosis can lead to better management and treatment of the condition, improving patient outcomes.

### About Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm commonly used for classification tasks. SVM works by finding the optimal hyperplane that best separates data points of different classes in a high-dimensional space. In the context of this project, SVM is used to classify whether an individual is likely to have diabetes based on input features.

**Key characteristics of SVM:**
- **Margin Maximization:** SVM aims to maximize the margin (distance) between the closest data points of different classes, known as support vectors. This helps improve the model's generalization to new data.
- **Kernel Trick:** SVM can use various kernel functions (e.g., linear, polynomial, radial basis function) to transform data into a higher-dimensional space, making it easier to separate data that is not linearly separable.
- **Robustness:** SVM is effective in high-dimensional spaces and is versatile due to its ability to use different kernel functions.

### Dependencies
